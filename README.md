# Video-Style-Transfer
Fast Style Transfer for Real-Time Video


The model uses the method described in [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) along with [Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022.pdf). The saved-models for examples shown in the README can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lrvwfehqdcxoza8/saved_models.zip?dl=0).
